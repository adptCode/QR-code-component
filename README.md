### What I learned

1. Creating a Basic Card in CSS
    I can design a visually appealing card without using libraries like Bootstrap, just with HTML and CSS.
    
2. Using Media Queries for Responsiveness
    Media queries are essential for adapting layouts to different screen sizes (e.g., desktop vs. mobile).

3. Responsive Design Best Practices
    Use percentages (%) for width to create fluid layouts.
    Test designs on multiple screen sizes to ensure usability across devices.

4. Separation of Concerns
    By keeping your HTML and CSS separate, you maintain a clean and organized codebase thatâ€™s easier to read, maintain, and update.
